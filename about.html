        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Felipe O. Cerezer, a biologist passionate about understanding large-scale patterns of biodiversity. 
            I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Czech Academy of Sciences and Charles University in the Czech Republic. 
            My research lies at the intersection of macroecology, macroevolution, and biogeography. I aim to uncover how historical, 
            evolutionary, and ecological processes shape the distribution of life on Earth.</p>

        <p>I was born in <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivor%C3%A1" target="_blank">Ivor√°</a>, a small town in southern Brazil, 
            nestled between the Atlantic Forest and the Pampa. I earned my BSc, MSc, and PhD in Biology at the Federal University of Santa Maria. 
            During my PhD, I had the opportunity to be a visiting researcher at WSL in Switzerland. I'm especially interested in how speciation, 
            extinction, and environmental factors like temperature and productivity interact to drive biodiversity patterns across regions and clades.</p>

        <p>Outside of academia, I enjoy outdoor activities like playing football and volleyball, hiking, and paddleboarding.</p>
