            <h1>About Felipe Cerezer</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Felipe Cerezer, a researcher and data scientist specializing in macroecology, macroevolution, and biogeography. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Charles University in Prague, focusing on understanding large-scale patterns in species diversity and the interplay between evolutionary, ecological, and environmental factors.</p>
            
            <p>In my work, I use advanced statistical and machine learning methods to explore how different factors, including environmental energy, ecological interactions, and historical processes, shape biodiversity patterns across the planet. My primary research interests include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Macroecology and species diversity</li>
                <li>Phylogenetics and evolutionary processes</li>
                <li>Geospatial data analysis and spatial modeling</li>
                <li>Ecological modeling and simulation techniques</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Aside from my research, I also have a strong passion for teaching and sharing knowledge. I am actively involved in mentoring students and writing tutorials on data science, R programming, and ecological modeling.</p>

            <h2>Education & Experience</h2>
            <p>I hold a Ph.D. in Ecology from [Your University], where I focused on the evolutionary ecology of mammalian species across different ecosystems. My academic journey has led me to collaborate with researchers around the world on various ecological and evolutionary projects.</p>
